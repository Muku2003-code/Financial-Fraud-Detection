# Financial Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions using real-world transaction data. The system is designed to proactively identify fraud and support business decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of more than 3.1 million financial transactions with features such as transaction type, transaction amount, sender and receiver balances, and a fraud label (`isFraud`).

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
- Analyze transaction patterns and identify key fraud indicators.
- Provide actionable insights for fraud prevention.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  

## Model Used
XGBoost Classifier (Gradient Boosting Algorithm)

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: 99.98%  
- ROC-AUC: 0.993  
- Precision (Fraud): 97%  
- Recall (Fraud): 68%  

Due to class imbalance, recall and ROC-AUC are considered more important than accuracy.

## Key Insights
- Fraud mainly occurs in TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions.
- High transaction amount is a strong indicator of fraud.
- Sudden changes in account balances often signal fraudulent behavior.

## Business Impact
This system can help financial institutions:
- Detect fraud in real-time.
- Reduce financial losses.
- Improve transaction security and customer trust.

## Future Improvements
- Improve fraud recall using threshold tuning and cost-sensitive learning.
- Deploy the model as a real-time web application.
- Integrate with streaming transaction systems.
